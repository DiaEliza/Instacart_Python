# Instacart_Python

## Overview
_Instacart, an online grocery store that operates through an app, already has very good sales but wants to uncover more information about its sales patterns. As a data analyst for Instacart, my task is to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data. To derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria._

## Context
_Instacart stakeholders are most interested in the variety of customers in their database and their purchasing behaviors. They assume they can’t target everyone using the same methods, and they’re considering a targeted marketing strategy. They want to target different customers with applicable marketing campaigns to see whether they affect the sales of their products. My analysis will inform what this strategy might look like to ensure Instacart targets the right customer profiles with the appropriate products._
